# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This project utilizes HTML, Javascript, and CSS. This project displays a web page that has a map with your marked location. When choosing a destination the location marker will go through all the bus stops you must travel to in order to reach your destination.
# How to run
Open the project locally and get a mapbox api key and then set its value to your api key.Finally open in index.html.
# Roadmap of future improvements
I would add fastest bus route options and more design in css.
